# Data Science at Scale - Capstone Project

This project uses real world data from Detroit, Michigan and applies
data science techniques and tools to construct a model and predict from set
of buildings which are likely to be blighted and abandoned, before resulting in
a costly demolition of the property.

The data sources include 4 data sets:

* detroit-blight-violations.csv : Each record is a blight violation incident.
* detroit-demolition-permits.tsv: Each record represents a permit for a demolition.
* detroit-311.csv: Each record represents a 311 call, typically a complaint
* detroit-crime.csv: Each record represents a criminial incident.
